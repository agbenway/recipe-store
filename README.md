# recipe-parent
Collect recipes that get sent to my gmail and rate them/add additional instructions for changes made. 

Initially look for emails from example@gmail.com and in INBOX.
Get each message to see if there is a link in it.
If there is a link, store the link in the DB & retrieve information from the website.

Store: link, name of recipe, date sent, if we made it, any changes to the recipe, rating. Other possibilities, favorite recipe, how long it takes, type of meal (side dish, entree, one pot, quick, breakfast, etc.).

UI for this? Rate the recipes, view them, search by terms, add recipes.
